    "text": "Bond’s Can’t Help But Be Terrible\nOne thing I found helpful early in my career was knowing bond math well, or better, at least, than the stock jockeys on the desk. If it wasn’t buried in the rubble of the World Trade Center, I’d show you my copy of Marcia Stigum’s 1979 book, “The Money Market.” Like the HP-12C calculator, it’s a classic and equally unapproachable. If there is anything more boring than the subtleties of day count conventions in security pricing, I haven’t found it yet. More interesting are the nuances of “duration” and “convexity.” This is what concerns us today.\nApologies if you know all this, but bear with me and permit some simplification. We’re not on a trading desk (Ahh, good times. Sigh). Duration is a measure typically quoted in years. It is the weighted average time to receipt of a bond’s cash flows, both coupon and principal. The flows are weighted by the “time value of money.” It simply means a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. How much more depends on the interest rate or yield of the bond. In a world of higher yields two things happen. The bond coupons are larger as a fraction of the final principal payment and the more we value the closer-in-time cash flows. So, when yields are high, the weighted time to get our money back is shorter and the duration is shorter. Right now, the duration of the 10-year maturity T-Note is about 8.6 years. Now consider the case of a zero-coupon bond. The ONLY cash flow is at maturity. Then the yield doesn’t matter. The duration equals the maturity.\nWe quote duration in years but the number is shorthand for what we really care about. It tells us approximately how much the price of a bond will change given move in yields. Today’s 10-Year will fall in price by roughly 8.6% if it’s yield rises from 3.26% to 4.26% (Get out your HP-12C if you want to know the exact answer). Therein lies an important reason why today’s bond sell off is so brutal. Go back to that bond bear market in 1987. The Fed hiked rates more and bond yields rose almost as much as they have this time, yet the bond price declines were milder because the duration of the market was much shorter for each maturity. The duration of each maturity of the Treasury market has been rising for 40 years while interest rates have been coming down. The market has gotten riskier just due to the math of lower rates. Trough to peak, the 30-year Treasury has extended from 7 to 25 years in duration! Yikes! I don’t watch much CNBC but I don’t think duration is a big topic. Neither Greg Ip or Jason Zweig at the Wall Street Journal seem have talked about it, either. Duration deserves more attention.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a silver lining and it’s called convexity. We know that as yields go up, duration goes down, so the worse the market gets, for each subsequent basis point1 yield move the smaller the price changes are. Likewise, in bull markets for bonds, price gains accelerate. This is called “positive convexity.”\nThe bottom line is this: It is true that shorter maturity bonds are less volatile than longer maturity bonds but today’s bonds aren’t your father’s bonds. Today’s bonds have way more price risk, whatever you think about the Fed’s actions.\nAs an aside, one reason government-backed mortgage bonds from GNMA deserve a yield premium is they have “negative convexity.” Can you figure out why? Answer in my next note.\nMore importantly, we’ll answer a more interesting question: “How do I make money now?”\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nOne basis point equals 1/100th of a percentage point.↩︎"

    "text": "One thing that makes pundits boring is their endless explanations of the past (Oops, guilty) with scant conviction on what the future holds. So let’s get to that. “They” will tell you that the yield curve is inverted because 10s are lower than 2s. “They” are wrong. I stick to my prediction of the Spring. Bond markets will continue to suffer until the Funds rate climbs above the 10-year yield. See my post from March 2022 for the rationale. It has aged pretty well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be clear, the long end has a long way to go and the funds rate even longer. \nThe market must be shocked and awed by the level of the funds rate or the inflation rate will remain stubbornly high.\n\n\n\n… and …\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the “typical” tightening cycle we find stocks enter a brief correction when the weathervane at the top of the Fed swings around to tightening but continue on their merry way after a month or so. Only when the hikes truly bite - inversion happens, a recession is triggered - do we we see the market crap out. This time I see a long winter ahead, without much of a respite during the tightening phase.\n\n\n\nMy dodge is I don’t predict what that level will be. I have seriously heard people say things like “Well, after the next hike we’ll be there.” They forget that the bond market can move too, and it will. As James Makintosh writes in the Wall Street Journal, just as the Fed is behind the curve, so are investors. Hindsight bias means people are still unappreciative of how high rates can go, unless you are old, like me.\nOne of the contradictions of market forecasters and curve shape is that when the curve inverts it predicts a recession and a recession is bad for the markets. My friends at Deutsche Bank produce a very nice probit model based on the yield curve that shows the probability of recession. As a trader, I don’t care. The problem is macroeconomic data is a lagging indicator of what markets do and so is useless for market forecasting. The forecasters’ logic is circular.\nNOT TRUE:\nMarkets –predict-> Economy –predict-> Markets\n\n\n\nThe nice thing about Fed Funds vs. long rates is it signals a bond market bottom. We don’t have to agonize over whether, several years from now, the NBER will label the current moment a recession.\nSo I have a clear view that when the “true” inversion happens the bond market will have bottomed and it’s time to get in. The same is not true for stocks, as I said in my last note. So, avoid stocks. Cash is king but the next trade is to buy bonds. In the chart below, the green zone shows the “true” inversion periods and thus the “buy zone.” How reasonable is that proposition?\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove we see the inversion periods. What happens to bond yields when we enter those zones? The economy truly slows down, inflation abates and Treasury bond prices start to rise again. That is evident from the chart below.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “buy” signal is not as clear-cut as we would like. The timing could be tricky and we see at least one false signal in the late 90s. I have some optimism that we will get a good signal this time. Why? Inflation is stubborn and the level of the Funds Rate we will have to reach to bring it down is going to be “pretty high.” The consequence of being so far behind means the Fed will have to overshoot to show it means business. This suggests the slowdown will be pronounced. Bond yields will start their rally from levels we haven’t seen since the naughts. Remember when a 5% bond yield seemed normal? It will again, soon.\nWhat would have happened had the Fed started raising rates a year ago? Could we have seen only a modest rise in long rates, like we did in the last two tightening cycles? We’ll never know. Few people remember Ben Bernanke’s comments in the wake of the financial crisis where he said that rate levels that were formerly considered neutral “are contractionary today.” Or Janet Yellen’s comments that previously “too high” levels of inflation might have to be tolerated for brief periods while the financial system remains fragile. The Fed is reaping the fruits of their own anchoring on the financial crisis of 2008-2009.\nAre we doomed to see a reversal of the 40-year rally in bonds? Now the Fed has gotten the message, it seems. In the CPI run up after the first oil shock in 1973, the Fed’s response was insufficiently vigorous. They are on the case now and that’s why I think the Funds Rate is going higher than you think.\nSo we have a time, give or take, to buy bonds. Unfortunately for stocks, when this curve shape occurs (and not before) it shows investors finally are resigned to a real recession beginning. This is when it gets tough for company earnings. The bottom for equities will come later.\nIn my next note we’ll try to come up with a trading rule around when to buy bonds and how long to hold them. In the meantime, remember, cash is king."
